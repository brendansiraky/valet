milestone: v1.2 Multi-Provider & Artifacts
phase: Between 13 and 14
status: clean_break

<current_state>
v1.2 is 75% complete (phases 11-13 done, phase 14 remaining).
v1.3 (Agent DNA & Dynamic Traits) is fully planned and ready after v1.2 ships.

Clean break point — not mid-task, not mid-plan.
</current_state>

<completed_this_session>

**v1.2 Progress:**
- Phase 11: Provider Abstraction Layer ✓
- Phase 12: OpenAI Integration ✓
- Phase 13: Model Selection UX ✓

**v1.3 Planning:**
- Defined milestone scope through questioning
- Created 21 requirements across 6 categories (AGUX, TEST, TCOL, PIPE, DATA, CLEN)
- Created roadmap with 3 phases (15-17)
- Key feature: traits move from agent-level to pipeline-level
- Added: remove template variable system ({{placeholder}}) entirely

</completed_this_session>

<remaining_work>

**To finish v1.2:**
- Phase 14: Artifact Storage
  - Database schema for artifacts (JSONB storage)
  - Store outputs with metadata (date, pipeline, cost, model)
  - Artifact viewer UI (view-only)
  - Link artifacts to pipeline runs

**After v1.2:**
- `/gsd:complete-milestone` to archive v1.2
- `/gsd:discuss-phase 15` to start v1.3

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**v1.3 Decisions:**
- "DNA" naming for agent instructions (human metaphor)
- Traits at pipeline-level (more flexible than agent-level)
- Temporary trait picker for agent testing (no persistence)
- Preset color swatches only (warm palette, 8-12 colors)
- Set deduplication for duplicate traits (silent ignore)
- Traits attach to node edges (top/bottom, not inline)
- Remove template variable system entirely (DNA + traits + flow is sufficient)

</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None.

<context>
User wants to improve UX for non-technical users. The key insight is:
- "Instructions" → "DNA" (human metaphor for agent's core identity)
- Traits become dynamic per-pipeline-step config (drag to attach in pipeline builder)
- Template variables were over-engineered; context (DNA + traits + output flow) is enough

The pipeline builder will have traits in the left sidebar, draggable to agent nodes.
Traits appear as colored chips on top/bottom of agent nodes.
