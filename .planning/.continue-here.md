<current_state>
Just started v1.2 milestone initialization. User provided complete milestone plan in the prompt. Haven't written any files yet - was reading existing PROJECT.md and STATE.md to understand current state when paused.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Read PROJECT.md - understood v1.1 is complete
- Read STATE.md - confirmed ready for new milestone
- Verified no REQUIREMENTS.md or ROADMAP.md exist at root level (they're in milestones/ for v1.1)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
Per user's plan, need to:
1. Update PROJECT.md with v1.2 milestone info
2. Create REQUIREMENTS.md with finalized requirements (MPROV, MODL, AGNT, ARTF)
3. Create ROADMAP.md with phases 11-14
4. Then start with `/gsd:plan-phase 11`

The user provided a complete plan with:
- 4 phases: 11-Provider Abstraction, 12-OpenAI Integration, 13-Model Selection UX, 14-Artifact Storage
- Key decisions: live link agent-pipeline relationship, orphan handler for deleted agents, abstraction layer first, DB storage with JSONB
- Requirements organized by domain (MPROV, MODL, AGNT, ARTF)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
These decisions were made in planning discussion (from user's plan):
- Agent-Pipeline: Live link with orphan handler for deleted agents
- Multi-Provider: Abstraction layer first, Anthropic + OpenAI initial
- API keys: One key per provider in settings
- Model UX: Flat dropdown with provider grouping, mix freely in pipelines
- Feature parity: Best effort, graceful handling
- Artifact storage: PostgreSQL with JSONB, structured format with metadata
- Output: View only (edit/branch deferred to v1.3+)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - just starting
</blockers>

<context>
User exited plan mode with a complete v1.2 milestone specification. The plan mentions fetching OpenAI docs via MCP for SDK patterns - that's needed for Phase 12 research. The immediate task is just setting up the milestone docs, then we'd start planning Phase 11 (Provider Abstraction).
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: Update .planning/PROJECT.md to reflect v1.2 as active milestone, then create REQUIREMENTS.md and ROADMAP.md based on user's plan content. The user's plan in the prompt contains all the details needed.
