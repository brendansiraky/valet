<objective>
Add orphan detection for deleted agents in pipelines (backend).

Purpose: When a user deletes an agent that's used in a pipeline, execution should fail clearly rather than silently skip steps or produce incomplete output.

Output: Clear error messages when pipelines reference deleted agents.

Note: Visual indicator in pipeline builder UI deferred to Phase 13 (Model Selection UX) which already handles pipeline builder changes.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add orphan detection in buildStepsFromFlow</name>
  <files>app/services/job-queue.server.ts</files>
  <action>
Modify buildStepsFromFlow() to detect and report deleted agents:

1. Add tracking array: `const orphanedAgents: string[] = [];`

2. In the agent lookup loop, when agent is not found:
   ```typescript
   if (!agent) {
     // Use agentName from node.data if available (stored when agent was added to pipeline)
     const agentName = node.data.agentName ?? agentId;
     orphanedAgents.push(agentName);
     continue; // Don't add to steps
   }
   ```

3. After building steps, check for orphans:
   ```typescript
   if (orphanedAgents.length > 0) {
     throw new Error(
       `Pipeline cannot run: ${orphanedAgents.length} agent(s) have been deleted: ${orphanedAgents.join(", ")}. Please update the pipeline.`
     );
   }
   ```

4. The error will be caught by the worker's error handler and:
   - Update run status to "failed"
   - Store error message in run record
   - Emit error event to client

This is fail-fast: We detect ALL orphans before execution starts, not one at a time.

Test scenario:
1. Create a pipeline with 2 agents
2. Delete one agent from the agents list
3. Try to run the pipeline
4. Verify: Run fails with clear error naming the deleted agent
5. Verify: No partial execution occurred
  </verify>
  <done>
- buildStepsFromFlow detects deleted agents
- Error message lists all deleted agent names
- Pipeline run marked as failed with descriptive error
- No partial execution when agents are missing
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. TypeScript compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit`
2. Delete agent -> run pipeline with that agent -> fails with clear error
3. Error message includes agent name, not just ID
4. Run status shows "failed" in database
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Deleted agents cause clear, early failure with descriptive message
- Users know exactly which agents are missing
- No silent failures or partial execution
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/11-provider-abstraction/11-03-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
