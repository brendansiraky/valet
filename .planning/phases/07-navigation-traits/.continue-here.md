<current_state>
Phase 7 (Navigation & Traits) is COMPLETE and VERIFIED. Ready to proceed to Phase 8.

Both plans executed successfully in parallel:
- 07-01: Sidebar navigation with authenticated layout
- 07-02: Traits CRUD system

Verification passed: 6/6 must-haves verified.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
**Plan 07-01: Sidebar Navigation**
- Task 1: Installed shadcn sidebar components (sidebar, tooltip, collapsible, sheet)
- Task 2: Created authenticated layout with sidebar (app/layouts/authenticated.tsx)
- Task 3: Updated routes.ts to use layout() wrapper for auth routes

**Plan 07-02: Traits CRUD**
- Task 1: Created traits database schema and ran migration
- Task 2: Created trait UI components (trait-card, trait-form-dialog)
- Task 3: Created traits route with full CRUD actions
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
Phase 7 complete. Next phase:

**Phase 8: Agent Configuration**
- User can set capability on agent definition (none / web search / URL fetch)
- User can set model per agent (defaults to global setting)
- User can assign traits to agents
- Agent execution includes assigned trait context in the prompt

Phase 8 needs planning before execution.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- shadcn sidebar with collapsible="icon" for collapse behavior
- layout() wrapper in routes.ts centralizes auth checking (no duplication per route)
- Cookie-based sidebar state persistence (shadcn default)
- Trait context max 50000 chars (larger than agent instructions for reusable context blocks)
- Traits follow same CRUD pattern as agents (intent-based form actions)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None.
</blockers>

<context>
Milestone v1.1 is 25% complete (1/4 phases). Phase 7 added:
1. Persistent sidebar navigation on all authenticated pages
2. Traits system for reusable context snippets

Phase 8 will connect traits to agents and add agent configuration (capability, model, trait assignment).

App is working - sidebar navigation functional, traits CRUD tested and verified.
