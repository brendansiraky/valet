## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for milestone v1.1 (Enhanced Agents). Each maps to roadmap phases.

### App Navigation

- [x] **NAV-01**: App has persistent sidebar navigation on authenticated pages
- [x] **NAV-02**: Sidebar can be collapsed/expanded

### Traits System

- [x] **TRAIT-01**: User can create a trait (name + context text)
- [x] **TRAIT-02**: User can edit an existing trait
- [x] **TRAIT-03**: User can delete a trait
- [x] **TRAIT-04**: User can view their trait library

### Agent Configuration

- [x] **AGNT-08**: Agent has model setting (Claude models, defaults to user's global)
- [x] **AGNT-09**: Agent can have traits assigned
- [x] **AGNT-10**: Assigned trait context is included when agent executes

Note: AGNT-07 (capability dropdown) was removed. All agents now have unified tools (web search + URL fetch) — model infers from context.

### Pipeline Capabilities

- [x] **PCAP-01**: Pipeline execution supports web search capability
- [x] **PCAP-02**: Pipeline execution supports URL fetch capability

Note: Implemented via unified runWithTools — all pipeline agents have web search + URL fetch available.

### Cost Visibility

- [x] **COST-01**: User sees token count after pipeline run
- [x] **COST-02**: User sees estimated cost after pipeline run

### Agent UX (Dropped)

- [~] **AGUX-01**: Test dialog input is labeled "Test input" (not "Your prompt") — N/A (capability dropdown removed)
- [~] **AGUX-02**: Test dialog uses agent's capability (no dropdown) — N/A (unified tools, no dropdown)
- [~] **AGUX-03**: Test dialog clearly indicates purpose (testing before pipeline use) — N/A (simplified)
